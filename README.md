## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character uses a common Gilded Age technology (a telegraph, a phonograph, an electric light) and it begins to respond not to its function, but to their unspoken emotional state.
- Create a journal entry from Eleanor's perspective, detailing her observation of Silas's transformation and her own fears for their future, using the fading objects in their home as metaphors.
- Imagine a confrontation between Julian Stanhope and a lower-level technician in his employ who has accidentally discovered an 'echo' of Harrington's work in the mainstream electrical grid.
- Write a 'lost' fragment from Alistair Harrington's notes, written in a blend of scientific observation and symbolic poetry, describing his first successful 'conversation' with the wire.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for 'programming' Silas's special wire, using period-appropriate tools like tuning forks, harmoniums, or Leyden jars as inputs. How would the 'code' be represented?
- Prototype a simple physical or digital model that demonstrates the core aesthetic: an object that responds to sound or vibration not with sound, but with a different physical behavior (e.g., light patterns, movement, temperature change).
